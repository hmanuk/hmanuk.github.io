Hey there! I'm currently a research scientist at the Naval Information Warfare Center Pacific ([NIWC Pacific](https://www.niwcpacific.navy.mil)) in San Diego, CA. My work largely orbits the intersections of AI/ML and unconventional (neuromorphic) computing, from both [hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memristor) and [algorithmic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiking_neural_network) perspectives. I'm fascinated by modern AI systems, their ['physics'](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/) and [limitations](https://arcprize.org), and what can be done to overcome them. More broadly, I'm also interested in self-organization and collective phenomena, which frequently arise in complex systems, and how we might utilize such properties for efficient computation and learning.

Before joining NIWC, I completed a PhD in physics at UC San Diego with Professor [Di Ventra's group](https://diventra.physics.ucsd.edu). My research focused on the brain-inspired computing paradigm, memcomputing, and its applications to deep learning and combinatorial optimization. I spent an inordinate amount of time thinking about non-linear systems, [Boltzmann machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_machine), and [Ising spin-glasses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model).

I was awarded a DoD SMART scholarship and participated in several summer internships at NIWC, as well as at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk) in London, UK, where we studied the curious problem of neural [program synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_synthesis).

As an undergraduate, I attended UC Santa Cruz, where I was part of the [SLUG](https://astroslug.sites.ucsc.edu) computational astrophysics lab in Professor [Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz's group](https://www.ucolick.org/~enrico/home.html), trying to understand how stars undergo [tidal distruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_disruption_event) when they get too close to supermassive black holes.
