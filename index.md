Hey there! I'm currently a research scientist at the Naval Information Warfare Center Pacific ([NIWC Pacific](https://www.niwcpacific.navy.mil)) in San Diego, CA. My work mostly orbits the intersection of AI/ML (of course) and unconventional (neuromorphic) computing. More broadly, I'm deeply fascinated by collective phenomena arising in many-body systems, and how one might utilize them for computation.

Before joining NIWC, I completed a PhD in physics at UC San Diego as part of Professor [Di Ventra's group](https://diventra.physics.ucsd.edu). My research focused on the brain-inspired computing paradigm, memcomputing, and its applications to deep learning and combinatorial optimization. I spent an inordinate amount of time thinking about brains, Boltzmann machines, and Ising spin-glasses.

I was awarded a DoD SMART scholarship and participated in several summer internships at NIWC, as well as at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk) in London, UK, where we studied the curious problem of neural [program synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_synthesis).

As an undergraduate, I attended UC Santa Cruz, where I was part of the [SLUG](https://astroslug.sites.ucsc.edu) computational astrophysics lab in Professor [Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz's group](https://www.ucolick.org/~enrico/home.html), trying to understand how stars undergo [tidal distruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_disruption_event) when they get too close to supermassive black holes.
